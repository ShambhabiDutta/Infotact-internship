# SUMO Traffic Simulation

## Simulation Configuration

- City grid: 5 × 5
- Intersections: 25
- Cell/road length: 100 m
- Lanes: 1 lane per direction
- Speed limit: 13.9 m/s
- Simulation timestep: 1 second
- Simulation duration: 3600 seconds (1 hour)
- Random seed: 42
- Traffic demand: 600 vehicles/hour

## Vehicle Types

- Car: 420 vehicles/hour
- Bus: 90 vehicles/hour
- Truck: 90 vehicles/hour

All vehicle types have a maximum speed of 13.9 m/s.

## Traffic Lights

SUMO-generated static traffic-light programs are currently used.

The generated program uses:
- Traffic Lights: Static    SUMO-generated traffic-light programs with 30-second green and 3-second yellow phases.
- Two-direction signal phases

The traffic-light control will later be replaced/controlled through TraCI by the RL environment.
